## Overview
Inbound message processing pipeline: routing, commands, policy, sessions.

## Emoji Reaction Approval

Reaction-capable channels — Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, Feishu,
iMessage, **Mattermost**, **Matrix** — convert inbound emoji reactions into
`InboundMessage(metadata={"reaction": True, "target_message_id": ...})`.

> **Invariant.** Every reaction inbound is built with `mentioned=True` so it
> survives `BaseChannel._emit_inbound`'s default `SELECTIVE_POLICY`
> (`group=MENTION_ONLY`). Reactions are precise, user-driven gestures aimed at
> a specific bot message, not group-chat noise — gating them on `@mention`
> would silently drop every group-chat approval. Pinned by
> `tests/channels/test_reaction_inbound_policy.py::TestReactionConstructionSiteContract`.

`parse_approval_command` (commands.py) recognises a unified, three-tier
approval alphabet (skin-tone modifiers and Unicode variation selectors are
normalised away by `normalize_approval_emoji`):

| Decision        | Emojis                                         | Text aliases                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `allow_once`    | 👍, ❤, ✅, 🤝, 💪                              | `/approve`, `1`, `y`/`yes`, `ok`, 同意, 好的 |
| `allow_always`  | ♾️, ⭐                                         | `/approve-always`, `/always`, `aa`, `!y`, 永远允许 |
| `deny`          | 👎, ❌, 🚫                                      | `/deny`, `2`, `n`/`no`, 拒绝, 不行         |

`_is_reaction_approval_valid` in `router_commands_approval.py` enforces a layered gate:
1. **Pending-approval check** — the chat must have an active interrupted task.
2. **Target match** — when the reaction carries `target_message_id`, it must
   equal the cached approval message id (`_approval_msg_ids`).
3. **Approver authorisation** — in **group chats**, the reacting `sender_id`
   must equal the original requester (`_ActiveTask.requester_id`) or appear in
   the configurable `approval_co_approvers` allow-list. DMs skip this step.

`_handle_approval_command` then converts the three-tier decision into the
exact payload `myrm-agent-harness.apply_approval_decisions` expects:

- `allow_once`   → `{"type": "approve"}`
- `allow_always` → `{"type": "approve", "extensions": {"allowAlways": True}}`
  — drives `add_to_allowlist_if_needed` once the channel agent executor has
  bound the user via `set_approval_user_id`.
- `deny`         → `{"type": "reject", "feedback": "..."}`

## ActionButton Callback Approval

`ApprovalRegistry.create_approval()` pushes `ActionButton`s (✅ Approve / ❌ Deny)
to IM channels when `chat.source != "web"`. Each channel encodes the
`action_id` (`approval:{approve|deny}:{record_id}`) into its native callback
format (Telegram `act:...`, Slack `block_actions`, Discord `custom_id`, etc.).

When the user clicks a button, the channel's inbound parser strips the
transport prefix and delivers `InboundMessage(content="approval:approve:{id}",
metadata={"callback_prefix": "act", "origin_message_id": ...})`.

`_consume_loop` in `router.py` intercepts this **before** `parse_approval_command`
(which only handles text/emoji input) with a dedicated guard:

```python
if msg.metadata.get("callback_prefix") == "act" and msg.content.startswith("approval:"):
    asyncio.create_task(self._handle_action_button_approval(msg))
```

`_handle_action_button_approval` in `router_commands_approval.py` then:

1. **Parses** action (`approve`/`deny`) and `approval_id` from content.
2. **Authorises** — in group chats, only the original requester or a
   co-approver may resolve (same policy as reaction approval).
3. **Resolves** via `ApprovalRegistry.resolve_approval()` — only PENDING
   records are updated; already-resolved approvals return `None` and the
   handler exits (prevents status flip on duplicate button clicks).
4. **Edits** the original IM message to show `✅ Approved by @user` and
   prevent further confusion from stale buttons.
5. **Routes by type** — if `record.action_type == "outbound_draft"`, calls
   `_resolve_outbound_draft` to send or discard the held channel message
   (no LangGraph resume needed). Otherwise, **resumes** the interrupted
   LangGraph agent via `SessionGate.submit()` with a `resume_value`
   payload, or publishes `APPROVAL_RESOLVED` event if no active task
   exists in the router (e.g. WebUI concurrent resolve).

## `/new` Session Boundary Cleanup

`_handle_new_session` in `router_commands_session.py` performs a three-phase cleanup
before marking the peer for a fresh Chat:

1. **Abort running task** — `_abort_session_task(state_key, …)` cancels
   `cancel_token`, the `asyncio.Task`, cleans up the placeholder, and clears
   `_approval_msg_ids`. This is the same helper used by `/stop`.
2. **Flush pending queue** — `SessionGate.clear_pending_for_key(state_key)`
   drops all queued inbound messages to prevent them from bleeding into the
   new session.
3. **Reset per-session flags** — YOLO mode (`_session_yolo`) and personality
   overrides (`_session_personality`) are cleared so the new session starts
   with default behaviour.

Only after cleanup does `handle_new_session` (commands.py) flag the peer and
send the confirmation reply.

## Stuck Task Watchdog

`_janitor_loop` (60s interval) calls `_reap_stuck_tasks` to detect IM agent
tasks exceeding `_STUCK_TASK_TIMEOUT` (600s). For each stuck task:

1. **Cancel** — `cancel_token.cancel()` + `task.cancel()`.
2. **Resource cleanup** — stop typing indicators, clean up placeholder message
   with a localized timeout notification (`stuck_task_timeout_user_message`).
3. **State cleanup** — remove from `_active_tasks`, `_cleanups`, `_approval_msg_ids`.
4. **SessionGate release** — call `on_task_complete()` to unblock the session
   and allow pending messages to be processed.

This prevents semaphore exhaustion (max 5 concurrent tasks) and session
deadlocks when an agent execution hangs without crashing.
